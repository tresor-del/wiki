# Marckdown 

Markdown is a light text markup format and a processor to convert that to [HTML](/wiki/HTML). The originator describes it as follows:

Markdown is a text-to-[HTML](/wiki/HTML) conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or [HTML](/wiki/HTML)). 

To install it in your [Python](/wiki/Python) installation run **pip install markdown2**

However, everything you need to run this is in "lib/markdown2.py". If it is easier for you, you can just copy that file to somewhere on your **PythonPath** (to use as a module) or executable path (to use as a script).
